## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to establish a trustworthy and efficient feeling.
- Background color: Dark navy blue (#1A237E) to create a sleek, modern look suitable for nighttime use, as is common with ride-sharing applications. It also reduces eye strain.
- Accent color: A muted indigo (#5C6BC0) to complement the primary and background colors without overpowering them. This enhances visual appeal while ensuring important UI elements remain clearly visible.
- Clean and modern typography to ensure content is easily readable, particularly on smaller screens. Medium font weight is to be used for main content and bold font weight for titles to create a clear visual hierarchy.
- Simple, minimalist icons to represent different transport options. Icons will match the white background to achieve high contrast with the dark navy blue background, and ensure ease of recognition and quick interaction.
- Mobile-first approach with a focus on creating a seamless and responsive user experience. The app's layout will adapt fluidly across different devices.
- Subtle animations on the tap of different options.
